Like the heather of the Highlands, mine is tipped with flecks of purple<BR>
With a head as wise as Solomon, although shaped like a turtle<BR>
It wears a flesh-tone roll-neck and the neck goes up and down<BR>
It comes out in the evenings and on Friday paints the town<BR>
Obsessively, compulsively, it only wants one thing<BR>
To fill your chosen orifice with ropes of pearly string<BR>
Delivering its message to your womb or to your tongue<BR>
And then going slack and flaccid when its pressing work is done<BR>
In witty conversation, by drip or intravenous<BR>
I drop everything you didn't want to know about my penis<BR>
- Momus<BR>

Just as it says on the tin—full page images of graffiti dicks and dongs bursting forth from the page in full color in an absolutely punishing 8.5”x11” format. Great for people who like to look at crudely drawn pictures of dicks—or occasionally just the word DICK in various contexts, sexual or otherwise!
