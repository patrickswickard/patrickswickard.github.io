I didn't have enough for a car, what a bummer<BR>
I had to get a job driving taxis last summer<BR>
All the other drivers knew that my car was spectacular<BR>
Cause I had a tight, very bright yellow Acura<BR>
Piling in 9 or 10 skins at a time, G<BR>
Funny how the honeys with the money always find me<BR>
Paying their green to see what color my house is<BR>
Feeling like Del cause they would sleep on my couches<BR>
I'd charge senior citizens extra, cause they never mention<BR>
I'd take all the money from they pension<BR>
And I'd drive a blind man around for a while<BR>
Even if he only had to travel just a mile, with a smile<BR>
And don't let your dog off the leash<BR>
Cause if he stepped then I would have to squash the beast<BR>
And if you didn't have the right change, don't even ask me<BR>
Or I would have ran your ass down with my taxi<BR>

Deliberately unflattering memoir by Baltimore-based writer Patrick Swickard about his experiences driving a taxi in Wisconsin in the early 2000s, back in the days before Uber and Lyft and Google Maps on smartphones. For those who know the author, this will probably answer a lot of questions about “how’d he get to be like that?” For those who don’t, just strap in and enjoy the ride. Or don’t enjoy it—the fare costs the same either way. A cheap pulpy read!
