If you're a megastar, words will buy you a car<BR>
I'd rather go barefooting, for prints I will be putting<BR>
All over the earth if we can get there first<BR>
Now that we are in it, footprints are being printed<BR>
So if you recognize 'em, you can try to size 'em<BR>
They'll probably be the ones with the size nine flying<BR>
All over the field, you won't have to yield<BR>
If you want protection you can hide behind the shield<BR>

The holidays begin.  Footprints.  Scenes from Canton.  Faded sensations.  Guerrilla knitting.  Greektown and Highlandtown.  More counterfeit 7-11s.  Rough looking pumpkins and fresh snowmen.  Christmas village.  Streetcar museum.  Falls Road.  To Hampden the back way.  Yard cows.  Storm drains.  Church signs.
