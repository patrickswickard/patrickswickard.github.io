	I like to pass on<BR>
	The feeling of great joy I found in Eckankar<BR>
	For those who have ears to hear<BR>
	For I, too, have had<BR>
	A longing deep inside, never knowing where to hide<BR>
	For one day up, the next day down<BR>
	<BR>
	No longer am I tied to this earth world<BR>
	Its troubles are old<BR>
	I have no fear of death no more<BR>
	Since on the path of Eck<BR>
	Greatest is he that moveth his own spirit<BR>
	Then taketh a city for inner rulership<BR>
	Is the mastery of the masters<BR>
	This, too, can be yours<BR>
	- Sri Darwin Gross<BR>
