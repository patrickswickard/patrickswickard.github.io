Somebody saw you at the break of day<BR>
Dining and a-dancing in the cabaret<BR>
He was long and tall, he had plenty of cash<BR>
He had a red cadillac and a black moustache<BR>
He held your hand and he sang you a song<BR>
Who you been lovin' since I been gone<BR>
Who you been lovin' since I been gone<BR>
- Warren Smith<BR>

Hello ladies! This sexy edition of Sappho’s sexiest poems features the face of Hollywood heartthrob Tom Selleck staring out from the cover. Whet your appetite for spicy verse by gazing into his eyes and imagining the tickle of his moustache as you imagine him reading these poems to you in his soothing voice. (Could an audio book be far behind? Cross your fingers!)
