Now you know you're a cute little heartbreaker<BR>
You know you're a sweet little lovemaker<BR>
Hey<BR>
I wanna take you home<BR>
I won't do you no harm, no<BR>
You've gotta be all mine, all mine<BR>
Aw shucks, foxy lady<BR>

Sappho isn’t just for the ladies! You gentlemen poetry aficionados didn’t think Dull Boy Publications was going to leave you out in the cold, did you? That’s Sappho herself on the cover, as depicted by French painter Charles Mengin. What a rack—and the poetry is nice too!
