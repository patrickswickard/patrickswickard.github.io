This one is for the Bible scholars. Originally published in newsletter format, this ambitious and irreverent project is the work of our friends on the west coast, who are in the process of doing a verse-by-verse close study guide for the entire Bible. (Theyâ€™re almost finished with Genesis!) Complete with worksheets and study questions and essay assignments and even a Drawing Time section (with prompts and pages left blank for the reader to fill in their own sketches).
