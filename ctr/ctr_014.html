Now who's that babe with the fabulous shadow?<BR>
It's only one scene, but to me it don't matter<BR>
Her movies get down like you won't find in my hometown (oh no)<BR>
They won't believe it when they see what they're seein' (oh no)<BR>
Go see baby, now<BR>
Pictures on the silver screen<BR>
Greatest thing you've ever seen<BR>
Now her name is up in lights<BR>

Pole menus.  Pleasant View Gardens.  Scenes from around Orleans Street.  Douglass Homes.  Boxers.  Pepsi is watching you.  Pole fashion chaos.  Scenes from around Fells Point.  Bail prom.  Painted bar signs.  Beer barrels.  Dirty movies.
