<I>
Full fathom five thy father lies;<BR>
Of his bones are coral made;<BR>
Those are pearls that were his eyes:<BR>
Nothing of him that doth fade,<BR>
But doth suffer a sea-change<BR>
Into something rich and strange.<BR>
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:
Ding-dong.<BR>
Hark! now I hear them,â€”ding-dong, bell.<BR>
