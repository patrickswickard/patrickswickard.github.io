Well, the men come in these places<BR>
And the men are all the same<BR>
You don't look at their faces<BR>
And you don't ask their names<BR>
You don't think of them as human<BR>
You don't think of them at all<BR>
You keep your mind on the money<BR>
Keeping your eyes on the wall<BR>
- Tina Turner<BR>

Graffiti on a theme. This second volume of a two volume set features full page images of faces on signs and graffiti, captured between 2013 and 2019. Great for when you want to take a break from reading for awhile.

These two volumes are honestly my favorite of the themed editions.
