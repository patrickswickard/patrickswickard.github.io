Do you hear the people sing?<BR>
Singing the song of angry men?<BR>
It is the music of the people<BR>
Who will not be slaves again!<BR>
When the beating of your heart<BR>
Echoes the beating of the drums<BR>
There is a life about to start<BR>
When tomorrow comes!<BR>
- Les Miserables<BR>

This classic work is Dickens at his most readable, but itâ€™s still a bit of a slog in its original version. So we at Dull Boy Classics decided to punch up the dialogue a bit for modern readers. A little bit of swearing for emphasis goes a long way toward making this work more accessible and exciting for modern readers who are looking for something a little more reminiscent of Tarantino and Scorsese. Same great story with a fresh coat of paint!
