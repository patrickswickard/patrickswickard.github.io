When I left my home and my family<BR>
I was no more than a boy<BR>
In the company of strangers<BR>
In the quiet of the railway station<BR>
Running scared<BR>
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters<BR>
Where the ragged people go<BR>
Looking for the places only they would know<BR>
-Simon and Garfunkel<BR>
