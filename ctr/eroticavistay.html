Say my name and everything just stops<BR>
I don't want you like a best friend<BR>
Only bought this dress so you could take it off<BR>
Take it off<BR>
Carve your name into my bedpost<BR>
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend<BR>
Only bought this dress so you could take it off<BR>
Take it off<BR>

A word cloud is a visualization technique which shows the most commonly used words in a text (aside from short words like “a” and “the” and “and”) in a convenient format where the font size corresponds to the frequency the word is used. It’s one way of quickly seeing the content of a piece of text. This book features word cloud visualizations (generated by Python) for numerous pieces of specifically Taylor Swift-themed erotica dredged from the depths of the internet. Dozens of one-handed reads featuring America’s Sweetheart, conveniently summarized for your prurient enjoyment!
