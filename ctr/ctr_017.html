Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,<BR>
Had a bad cold, nevertheless<BR>
Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,<BR>
With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,<BR>
Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,<BR>
(Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)<BR>
Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,<BR>
The lady of situations.<BR>
Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,<BR>
And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,<BR>
Which is blank, is something he carries on his back,<BR>
Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find<BR>
The Hanged Man. Fear death by water.<BR>
-T.S. Eliot<BR>

Nautical scenes from near Canton.  Lingering jack-o-lanterns.  The Hustler Club van.  Cone abuse.  Toynbee tiles.  Circus truck.  Palm readings.  A pale donkey.
