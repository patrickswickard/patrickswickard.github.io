Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads<BR>
A whale of a tale or two<BR>
'Bout the flappin' fish and the girls I've loved<BR>
On nights like this with the moon above<BR>
A whale of a tale and it's all true<BR>
I swear by my tattoo<BR>

A word cloud is a visualization technique which shows the most commonly used words in a text (aside from short words like “a” and “the” and “and”) in a convenient format where the font size corresponds to the frequency the word is used. It’s one way of quickly seeing the content of a piece of text. This book features word cloud visualizations (generated by Python) for numerous classics of English language literature.
