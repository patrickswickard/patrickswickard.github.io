	The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors you, and is dreadfully provoked. His wrath towards you burns like fire; he looks upon you as worthy of nothing else but to be cast into the fire. He is of purer eyes than to bear you in his sight; you are ten thousand times as abominable in his eyes as the most hateful, venomous serpent is in ours.<BR>

Some long walks around Greenmount West, Calvert, and North Avenue.  Early views of Graffiti Alley.  Rats and Easter Island heads in a vacant lot.  Decorated storm drains.  Dumpster caviar.  Open Walls Baltimore murals.  Bricks and bottles and batteries.  Values clashes.  Anti-diversity religious flyers left under windshield wipers while handmade wooden signs encourage viewers to "HELP OTHERS BE A MAN - PASS IT ON".  Ottobar show posters.  Darkman van.  Use what ya got.
