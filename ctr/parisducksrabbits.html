Images taken in Paris, France, in April of 2024. This double volume has images of ducks in the front. Flip it over and read from the back and it’s all images of rabbits.
<P>
I was inspired to make this because Paris is weirdly full of rabbit and duck imagery, which is especially noticeable around Easter. For example, many of the warning signs on the Metro feature bad things happening to rabbits who ignore the safety warnings—rabbits falling onto tracks, getting squashed by doors, etc. And that’s only the beginning. Ducks are also all over the place—rubber ducks (vibrating and otherwise) adorn the sex shop windows. I decided to gather these all in one place to capture this aspect of the city.

Note that a French language version of this same book is also available, <I>Les Lapins de Paris/Les Canards de Paris</I>, which features rabbits in the front and ducks in the back.
