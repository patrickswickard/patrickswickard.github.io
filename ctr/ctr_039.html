When you're alone and life is making you lonely<BR>
You can always go downtown<BR>
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry<BR>
Seems to help, I know, downtown<BR>
<BR>
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city<BR>
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty<BR>
How can you lose?<BR>
The lights are much brighter there<BR>
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares<BR>
<BR>
So go downtown<BR>
Things will be great when you're downtown<BR>
No finer place for sure, downtown<BR>
Everything's waiting for you<BR>
-Petula Clark<BR>

Open studios.  Phone books. Caution squares.  Cork Factory.  Free stuff.  ACAB.  Druid Hill Park and environs.  Carved trees.  A filled pool.  MDFF interactive ad.  Scenes from near Howard Street.  Downtown.  Pesticides.  Catheters.  A discarded firehose.
