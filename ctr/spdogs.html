Woof woof! This book features full-page images of everything dog-related. Plenty of dog-related signs and graffiti. Lots of great content related to where dogs are and are not allowed to walk, shit, piss, exist, and do other things that dogs like to do in the city.

Also available in a double volume with <I>Dogs of Baltimore</I>, see <I>Dogs of Baltimore/Gods of Baltimore</I>.
