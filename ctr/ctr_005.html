	Hats off to the new age hairstyle made of bones<BR>
	Hats off to the use of hats as megaphones<BR>
	Speak softly, drive a Sherman tank<BR>
	Laugh hard, it's a long way to the bank<BR>
	Do you sing like Olive Oyl on purpose?<BR>
	You guys must be into the Eurythmics<BR>
	<BR>
	For every one with dollar signs in his eyes<BR>

Scenes near city hall.  Street bananas.  Korean war relics.  Little Italy.  Street festival markings.  The Walters puts art on the streets.  Barbers and laundromats.  Band solicitations.
