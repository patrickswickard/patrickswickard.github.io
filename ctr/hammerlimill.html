Countless vermin gnashing at my face<BR>
Tear meat from my skull<BR>
Swarming, rabid, features are erased<BR>
Unrecognizable<BR>
Body covered, rat filled innards<BR>
Shred internal organs<BR>
Heart and lungs consumed from inside but my pain doesn't end<BR>
I have not died<BR>
Devour, cesspool of vermin<BR>
Devour, bloodthirsty rabid<BR>
Devoured by vermin<BR>
- Cannibal Corpse<BR>

A book of limericks inspired by Cannibal Corpse song titles. Good clean spooky Halloween fun! This version is the same limericks as the previous version, adorned with some pleasant open copyright images thrown in for good measure!

Disposal of the body. Sentenced to burn. From skin to liquid. Crushing the despised. Unleashing the bloodthirsty. Ecstasy in decay. Raped by the beast. Sickening metamorphosis. Condemned to agony. And more.
