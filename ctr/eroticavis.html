Sometimes I claimed my stories were real<BR>
Like the story about the leather clown<BR>
She had short, spiky black hair<BR>
Small, but perfectly formed breasts<BR>
And was always kitted out in the same outfit<BR>
Leather skirt, fishnet stockings<BR>
Floppy shoes, a big, red nose<BR>
A pair of leather wrist bracelets with spikes<BR>
A big, red smile painted on<BR>
And a big, shiny horn<BR>
Which she would honk and honk during sex<BR>
Until she had an orgasm<BR>
- King Missile<BR>

A word cloud is a visualization technique which shows the most commonly used words in a text (aside from short words like “a” and “the” and “and”) in a convenient format where the font size corresponds to the frequency the word is used. It’s one way of quickly seeing the content of a piece of text. This book features word cloud visualizations (generated by Python) for numerous pieces of erotica dredged from the depths of the internet. And boy are there some weird ones in here. Clown bimbo fetishes, balloons, and all kinds of other horrifying content, summarized in one chart for your convenience.
