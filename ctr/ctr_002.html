Some more walks around Mount Vernon, Station North, and Greenmount West.  Some shots of downtown at night.  Classic RNA and NGC.  Bicycle spoke cards.  Pesticide application warnings.  Orange cones.  DIY youtube.com rap video promo stickers stuck to light posts.  Pay phone decorations.  Slaps and graffiti from the usual band of hooligans.
