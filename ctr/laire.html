Candle lit, my eyes are slits<BR>
Jumpin' now, paper clip<BR>
Make a move, sail a ship<BR>
Tap it in, tap it in, ruby lips<BR>
She's a mixed up, shook up girl<BR>
Got me so strung out<BR>
I don't know what to do<BR>
She's a mixed up, mixed up, shook up girl<BR>

Posthumously-published collection of poems by Latvia Sylph, with introductory commentary and analysis by Professor V. Botkin and Denis Pog. Latvia Sylph has often been compared to her more famous contemporary, Sylvia Plath. Rumor has it that her poems were all composed as line-by-line anagrams of Plath’s poems, which is an interesting theory, but raises the question—what kind of an idiot would spend the time and effort performing such a mind-numbing awful task?
