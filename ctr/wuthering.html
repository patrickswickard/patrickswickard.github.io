Out on the wily, windy moors<BR>
We'd roll and fall in green<BR>
You had a temper like my jealousy<BR>
Too hot, too greedy<BR>
How could you leave me<BR>
When I needed to possess you?<BR>
I hated you, I loved you, too<BR>
Bad dreams in the night<BR>
They told me I was going to lose the fight<BR>
Leave behind my Wuthering, Wuthering<BR>
Wuthering Heights<BR>
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy<BR>
I've come home, I'm so cold<BR>
Let me in your window<BR>
- Kate Bush<BR>

Another lovely budget classic. This one seems to be loosely based on a song by Kate Bush. We at DBP teamed up with Bombas to bring you an affordable version of this classic by Charlotte Brontë or Jane Austen or maybe it was Willa Cather or one of those other women who write the scripts for chick flicks (<I>please confirm the author before publication</I>). The good folks at Bombas kicked in some dough to help us present a ninety-percent unadulterated version of this text, with a few ads for their socks seamlessly worked into the story. Seamless like their high-quality Merino wool socks, which will make your feet feel pampered with every wear! They didn’t give us any free samples, but we’ve heard good things about this product. And just to further warm your heart (along with your feet), portions of the proceeds of every sale go toward upcycling old socks that have been swapped out by unhoused persons and selling them to podcast listeners and literature lovers. Or something like that, we weren’t really clear on what their sales rep was trying to say about this. In any case, it’s all for a good cause. Reading this classic will make you a better person—unlike dreamy bad boy Heathcliff, who literally strangles puppies in this amazing and disturbing book. Reserve a copy today!
