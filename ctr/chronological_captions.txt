"IT WAS NOT ONLY A COMMUNITY, IT WAS FAMILY.  EVERYBODY KNEW EVERYBODY AND EVERYBODY TOOK CARE OF EACH OTHER...THOSE WHO DIDN'T HAVE, HAD ANYWAY.  BECAUSE OF THE RESPECT."

"...THE AVENUE ATTRACTED EVERYBODY TO JUST COME AND SOCIALIZE, BECAUSE THEY HAD THE ROYAL THEATRE AND THE TALENTS COMING FROM EVERYWHERE.  THEY WOULD DO THE MOVIES, AND THEN THE TALENT SHOWS...BEFORE THEY WOULD EVEN GET TO THE APOLLO."
"MY INTEREST IN JAZZ STARTED WHEN I WAS YOUNG.  I WOULD GO ON SATURDAYS TO THE LEFT BANK JAZZ SHOWS ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE AT THE TIJUANA, WHICH WAS AN INTERRACIAL JAZZ CLUB THEN...THAT'S HOW I MET MILES, COLTRANE, SONNY ROLLINS, ALL THE GIANTS."
