It's game time I think we need a ring or two<BR>
Ah-choo - I think I got the bird flu<BR>
Ah-choo - I think I got the bird flu<BR>
Purple orange and black<BR>
You know what I rap<BR>
Today I got on orange and my black baseball bat<BR>
The O's game on I'm watching on my 60 inch<BR>
I was born in '93 Cal Ripken was the man<BR>
You ain't gotta tell me 'bout them O's cause boy I been a fan<BR>
Frankie Robinson the first to put my team on the map<BR>
When I say Orioles I ain't talking 'bout the smack<BR>

Same content as the previous 8.5”x11” version, but its convenient pocket size makes it perfect as a field guide for bird lovers. A great gift for your favorite Baltimore bird nerd!
