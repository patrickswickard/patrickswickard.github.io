Well, the best thing about corn is the grease<BR>
The corn break can restore your energy<BR>
You really appreciate the hard work when you love something<BR>
If you or anyone loves corn, if you come to me, I can tеll you all about it<BR>
If I was surrounded by corn, I would eat all of it<BR>
Grow big and strong<BR>
Look at this, take a lump with thе knob<BR>
Spread butter on<BR>
Boil and toast it with the grease<BR>
Butter spreads out the good taste<BR>
I just saw corn as disgusting, but everything changed<BR>
