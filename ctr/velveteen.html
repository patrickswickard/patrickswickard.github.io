It must be your skin, I'm sinkin' in<BR>
It must be for real, 'cause now I can feel<BR>
And I didn't mind, it's not my kind<BR>
It's not my time to wonder why<BR>
Everything gone white, everything's grey<BR>
Now you're here, now you're away<BR>
I don't want this, remember that<BR>
I'll never forget where you're at<BR>
Don't let the days go by<BR>
Glycerine, glycerine<BR>

A stuffed rabbit longs to be real in Margery Williamsâ€™ classic, presented here with a lovely cover by Gustave Courbet. Surprise appearances by a skin horse and scarlet fever make this into a heavier read than you probably remember. Long live the new flesh!
