	I know my way 'round town<BR>
	Used to live around here<BR>
	I know the sites to see<BR>
	The things they mean to me<BR>
	And how we tore it down<BR>
	Let me walk with you<BR>
	'Cause it's breaking my heart<BR>
	The things that we had<BR>
	The good and the bad<BR>
	Now it's parking lots<BR>
	Don't let's talk about tomorrow<BR>
	Baby, standin' at the edge of sorrow<BR>
	Let's watch the whole world goin' slow<BR>
	Let's watch the whole world goin' slow<BR>
	- Pere Ubu<BR>

The journey begins!  This volume features such joys as nudes stenciled on the sidewalk, religious flyers, dog walking posters, raptured bronies, Port-a-John cartoons, hand-printed instructions for delivery drivers, boarded window art, classic STAB, the fence by Bell Foundry, and more.  Most images taken around Mount Vernon and Station North.
