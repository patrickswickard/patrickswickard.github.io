When the child's forehead, full of red torments,<BR>
Implores the white swarm of indistinct dreams,<BR>
There come near his bed two tall charming sisters<BR>
With slim fingers that have silvery nails.<BR>
<BR>
They seat the child in front of a wide open<BR>
Window where the blue air bathes a mass of flowers<BR>
And in his heavy hair where the dew falls<BR>
Move their delicate, fearful and enticing fingers.<BR>
<BR>
He listens to the singing of their apprehensive breath.<BR>
Which smells of long rosy plant honey<BR>
And which at times a hiss interrupts, saliva<BR>
Caught on the lip or desire for kisses.<BR>
<BR>
He hears their black eyelashes beating in the perfumed<BR>
Silence; and their gentle electric fingers<BR>
Make in his half-drunken indolence the death of the little lice<BR>
Crackle under their royal nails.<BR>
<BR>
Then the wine of Sloth rises in him,<BR>
The sigh of an harmonica which could bring on delirium;<BR>
The child feels, according to the slowness of the caresses<BR>
Surging in him and dying continuously a desire to cry.<BR>
-Arthur Rimbaud, tr. Wallace Fowlie<BR>
