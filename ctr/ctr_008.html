Do you know the importance of a skypager?<BR>
Those who don't believe, see you're laid behind<BR>
Got our skypagers on all the time<BR>
Hurry up and get yours, 'cause I got mine<BR>
Especially if you do shows, they come in fine<BR>
If you're with a G, and you're sippin' wine<BR>
Eatin' cacciatore with a twist of lime<BR>
Gotta meet your lover at a quarter to nine<BR>
Joint by base, then you get your high<BR>
-A Tribe Called Quest<BR>
