A trip up Guilford Ave.  Howard Street downtown.  Names in the sidewalk.  Practicing the alphabet with sidewalk chalk.  Drug dealer countermeasures.  A trip up Barclay.  Harwood.  Salon signs.  FMOT.  Theoretical evil ceramics.  Decorated orange smokestacks.  Stab van.  Grand Prix markings.  Downtown.  Psychic readings.  Wine signs.  Road closures.  Hopscotch.  Howard Street clowns.  An ugly bus stop brightened with an attractive photo of a building a few blocks away.  Wheat pastes and movie posters.  Trompe l'oeil on boarded up doorways.  Lexington Market.  Crabs.  Almost 7-11s.  More pole fashion.
