We are gathered here today, in these majestic halls of old<BR>
To honor a man they call Sathington Willoughby<BR>
There's a joke or two, a pun or three, I feel that must be told<BR>
Then I go on to speak of Sathington Willoughby<BR>
Sathington Willoughby, the legislator that penned us up a bill<BR>

Not going to lie. This book is a slog. All the characters have terrible and distracting Dickens names. Any modern reader will inevitably find themselves dismayed at the mind-numbing experience of reading the names Chuzzlewit and Pecksniff over and over. Taking inspiration from J.G. Ballard’s <I>The Atrocity Exhibition</I>, we at Dull Boy Classics decided to try and fix this issue by changing those names every time they came up to something new. Basically we wrote a Dickens name generator and replaced every instance of “Chuzzlewit” or “Pecksniff” with another random Dickensian surname still recognizably similar to the original. If you’re ever forced to actually read this book, your brain will thank you when every paragraph you’re presented variations such as “Snuzzlepit” or “Dickwhiff”. And at 762 sturdily-bound pages, this is heavy enough and compact enough to survive being hurled into the wall a few times in frustration!
