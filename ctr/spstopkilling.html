As I walk through this wicked world<BR>
Searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity<BR>
I ask myself, "Is all hope lost?<BR>
Is there only pain and hatred and misery?"<BR>
And each time I feel like this inside<BR>
There's one thing I wanna know<BR>
What's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding? Oh-oh<BR>
What's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?<BR>
- Elvis Costello<BR>

This is nothing but images of the iconic “We must stop killing each other” sign from around the time of the 300 Men March, circa 2015. Seeing these signs everywhere in neighborhoods full of these signs tacked up on boarded up vacant buildings definitely captured the mood of the time for me...
