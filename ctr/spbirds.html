Full page images of birds of all kinds within this 270 page monster. Baltimore is home to two sports teams featuring bird logosâ€”the Orioles and the Ravens. It was also ground zero for an electric scooter rollout by a company called Bird, whose scooters were all over the streets for a moment during the Rise of the Scooters. And on top of that, for awhile the walls of the city were extensively marked up during this era by a very prolific graffiti tagger who left his Bird all over. This volume presents all of those and more in images captured between 2013 and 2019.
