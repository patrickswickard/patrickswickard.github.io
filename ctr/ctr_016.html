Anything can happen on Halloween<BR>
Your dog could turn into a cat<BR>
There maybe a toad in your bass guitar<BR>
Or your sister could turn into a bat<BR>
<BR>
Christmastime brings the snow<BR>
Summertime brings the sun<BR>
But on Halloween your blood begins to run<BR>
Something spooky’s going down on<BR>
<BR>
Anything can happen on Halloween<BR>
It’s better than a video<BR>
Gremlins going to mess up every cassette<BR>
From London to Idaho<BR>
April 1st can be fun<BR>
New Year’s Eve is a ball<BR>
But on Halloween your flesh begins to crawl<BR>
Oh, I’m losing control<BR>
-The Worst Witch<BR>
