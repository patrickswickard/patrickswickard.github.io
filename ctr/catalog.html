Don't tell me you don't know what love is<BR>
When you're old enough to know better<BR>
When you find strange hands in your sweater<BR>
When your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote<BR>
I'm a man with a mission on two or three editions<BR>
And I'm giving you a longing look<BR>
Everyday<BR>
Everyday<BR>
Everyday I write the book<BR>
- Elvis Costello<BR>

Wait...how did this one get in here? Never mind, this one isn’t even published yet. But if it isn’t published yet, then how did you get your hands on a copy? How are you even reading this? Is this book real? Are you real? Am I real? Are we both only dreaming?
<P>
Hopefully I’ll figure all this out and be able to answer these questions before the 2025 catalog. But if this book even exists, then it’s likely to be all the books that Dull Boy Publications has put out so far as of October 2024. Stay tuned for more!
