<LI><a href="https://leaflet.perrotin.com/view/743/emptinesses">Perrotin Gallery</a> (thru April 6) Chiho Aoshima - Emptinesses | 76 rue de Turenne (3rd/Le Marais near Picasso Museum) "Chiho Aoshima has developed a universe that combines traditional Japanese references, memories of manga, science fiction, a love of nature and somewhat ambiguous female representations."</LI>
<LI><a href="https://www.operagallery.com/event/juan-genoves-agora-paris">Opera Gallery</a> Juan Genovés, Ágora  |  62 rue du faubourg Saint-Honoré (1st/Near Place de la Concorde/Tuileries) "Genovés's seemingly simple, almost abstract paintings conceal a more complex interpretation. Upon closer inspection, every character is unique, distinguished by individual attitudes and the use of real clothes and objects glued directly onto the canvas. The individual becomes a multitude, viewed from a bird's-eye perspective, almost akin to a cinematic scene. The crowd, silent and dispersed, is portrayed as miniature shadows. In Genovés's work, the human mass becomes an anonymous, recurring theme of history. Power, persecution, resistance, and displacement are some of the timeless themes that continue to resonate with viewers."</LI>
