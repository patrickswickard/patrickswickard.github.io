TEN THINGS YOU HATE ABOUT YOU
<P>
1. Like most people, you hate your physical flaws which are probably exaggerated in the mirror.
<P>
2. You hate your depression and seasonal affective disorder.
<P>
3. You hate how hard it is for you to get rid of physical objects. This is illogical. It's less about being likely to engage in nostalgia, and more about the fear you may someday want to and be unable to do so.
<P>
4. You hate your "fear of missing out" that sometimes drives you to poor choices and exhaustion.
<P>
5. You hate being scrupulous without necessarily being perceived by others as being ethical, which is the worst of both worlds.
<P>
6. You hate all your happy memories that are now melancholy and sad because people have left your life for various reasons.
<P>
7. You hate all your sad memories that now count as trauma for the trauma pile.
<P>
8. You hate that so much of your creativity is wasted on your brain writing terrible dreams and stress nightmares for you to experience every night.
<P>
9. You hate the amount of trouble that you have balancing being "street smart" with being either suspicious of strangers or completely dismissive of them, depending on whether they seem to present a threat.
<P>
10. You hate your difficulty in recognizing faces out of context, which is usually a minor nuisance but occasionally serves as one more source of anxiety that you don't need.
