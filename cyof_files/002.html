Upon watching this, you are a bit embarrassed that it took you so long to see this film. You're even more humbled when you realize that you did not, in fact, know the infamous "twist' going in. Instead, you suspected that it was some version of Poe's story "The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether", where the inmates had in fact taken over the asylum.
<P>
The Boston accents in this are distracting to you, more for contemplating how fast you normalize them than for how alien they sound. Your own accent is heavily colored by Indianapolis and Chicago, with a few lengthy passes through Wisconsin. You've had several friends from Boston with particularly obnoxious Boston accents to match. One was a phone sex operator (a platonic friend--you never utilized her services) who was a rather attractive woman. But on the phone she would often pretend to be anything but this. She specialized in "granny" calls where she would pretend to be a feeble old lady, or mommy-domme calls where she would angrily humiliate and discipline adult babies, acting as though she were their strict mother. All this was done without dropping her horrifyingly thick Boston accent, apparently.

You shudder at the action on the screen and imagine how uncomfortable it must be to be running around a storm like that in wet socks.
