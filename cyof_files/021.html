This is mostly a film about the desert. There's a bunch of Popul Vuh, creation myth, turtles, and other content, but mostly it's a film about the desert. This reminds you how important it is to hydrate.
<P>
Seriously. Hydrate every day. The first thing you should do in the morning at minimum is to drink a liter of water. Especially if you had anything to drink the night before.
<P>
Ideally you would get enough water from food not to worry about this, at least if you don't live in the desert. But let's face it. That's probably not going to happen. So drink some water. Especially if you live in the desert. You no longer live in the desert, unless you do--in which case this advice goes double.
<P>
Even better, you should drink something that, like Brawndo, has electrolytes in it. Luckily, you have at your fingertips a brilliant fake Pedialyte recipe that will quickly knock any mild undeserved hangover you may have accidentally accumulated via your rock star lifestyle.
<P>
What you are going to do is pause the movie and do the following. Gather one liter of water, preferably cold but not so cold that you can't drink it relatively quickly. Into this water you should put two tablespoons of sugar and a heaping half-teaspoon of salt. Shake the bottle vigorously and consume. You're off to a good start now.
<P>
If you have an actual hangover and need to move your bowels, now is a good time to do so. If you do not, then don't injure yourself trying. Either way you should take a hot shower, long enough so your eyes are no longer scratchy but not so long that your skin begins to dry out.
