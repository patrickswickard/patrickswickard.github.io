TITLE: Titane
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 075
<P>
Finally, a film where someone actually fucks a car!
<P>
Spoiler. Not only does she fuck a car, but she becomes impregnated by the car. Then she goes on a bit of an ill-advised fucking-and-killing spree that spirals out of control.
<P>
Then she shaves her head and tries to pass as a man. But not just any man. She tries to pass as the long lost son of a firefighter and becomes a firefighter herself, having to hide her female body and her burgeoning pregnancy from her father and the other firefighters.
<P>
Then she has the kid. Guess how that goes.
<P>
Don't worry, this has a female director. It's going to remind you of <I>Tetsuo</I>.

<P>
There are two types of women in this world. There are women who would want to fuck to this film and there are women who would <I>maybe</I> tolerate it but would absolutely not have any interest in fucking after watching this movie. When this was in the theater, you were wise enough to realize you were dating the second type of woman. You went to see something that wasn't this with her instead, though you did take her to <I>The Exorcist</I> when it was at the revival theater.
<P>
Now you're going to watch this film alone in your apartment and go to bed without dessert.
<P>
Keep it in your back pocket though for future reference. Someone may appreciate it someday.
