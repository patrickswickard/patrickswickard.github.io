TITLE: Shoot the Piano Player
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 232
<P>
This film is a little bit boring and disappointing considering your expectations for it. It's not bad, but it's not great when you compare it to something like <I>Elevator to the Gallows</I> or any film by Melville. It stars very famous singer-songwriter Charles Aznavour and it was directed by Francois Truffaut and it's French neo-noir, so it's quite easy to fall short of expectations. It's a bit like if you had Otto Preminger direct a noir film where Frank Sinatra plays a former heroin addict or something. Expectations can be pretty sky-high, but they can't all be winners.
<P>
You're not going to hate this or anything, but you will spend most of it wishing you were just listening to some Charles Aznavour songs. Oh well.
