The dessert the kid innocently eats instead of trading it to try to get in a girl's pants is moving, and the soundtrack cues associated with this are kind of beautiful.

<P>
What makes matters worse is that there are some very good films with names that are <I>almost</I> this. You love <I>Once Upon a Time in the West</I> and you were very pleasantly surprised by <I>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</I>. When you try to complain about this film, people will think you're an idiot and silently judge you or they will start to argue with you and defend the film they think you're attacking and you'll end up with enough friction to cause trouble before you find out you're talking about different films.
