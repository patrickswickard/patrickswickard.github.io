Crime films and police films hit a little bit different once you've had a few people pull a gun or knife on you. But that's not something you're going to be reading about or thinking very hard about in these pages.
<P>
This is a Melville film. It occurs to you that you can barely remember the actual plot of most Melville films. You can only remember how it <I>feels</I> to watch a Melville film. This one is about a cop, thus the name. Alain Delon is in it, being moody and pretty and enviable. Your Russian ex-girlfriend would still get in a tizzy over watching his films, especially on the big screen. She would text her giggling Russophone girlfriends about the fact she's watching a film with Ален Делон, and they'd respond with similar reactions that you could understand even with your rusty rudimentary Russian. Apparently he was quite a cultural hit in the former Soviet states, with a name and face and stoic charm that could easily permeate even the most Iron of Curtains.
<P>
Whenever Alain Delon's name would come up, which was shockingly often since he wasn't much on your radar before your Russian ex-girlfriend was part of your life, she would sing for you the chorus of one of her favorite Russian rock songs that was popular when she was a girl. Apparently (and not surprisingly) there was quite a problem with alcoholism in Russia back in those days. This led to several periods of prohibition and/or shortages that would make affordable alcohol difficult to obtain. Bad alcoholics would often fall back on drinking <I>eau de cologne</I>, which would often contain ninety percent alcohol.
<P>
You are reminded of one of her favorite Russian jokes, about a wino who goes to a corner store during one of these hard times and asks the owner to sell him a bottle of cologne. The shopkeeper recognizes him as one of the local drunks and refuses to fetch a bottle to sell to him, since he knows he is going to drink it. The wino swears to the shop-owner that yes, he used to be a drunk, but since alcohol became hard to come by he has cleaned up his act and gotten a job and is now a respectable man. And since cleaning up, he even has a date to prepare for that very night, thus the need for the cologne. The shopkeeper skeptically fetches a small bottle of cheap cologne for the man, who takes it and frowns and hands it back, asking the shopkeeper if he has any that has been refrigerated...
<P>
Anyway, the song your ex would always sing was a somewhat darkly funny song by a Russian rock band called Nautilus Pompilius, with a title that translates roughly to "A Glance from the Screen". It's somewhat like a Russian version of "Life on Mars", but about a sad girl with an alcoholic father who finds escapism through watching movies. The chorus has lyrics about "Alain Delon speaks French/Alain Delon drinks double bourbon, Alain Delon doesn't drink eau de cologne". Listening to the song is like banging Soviet zeitgeist into your veins in four minutes and twenty-six seconds.
