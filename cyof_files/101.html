TITLE: Happy People: A Year in the Taiga
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 101
<P>
This is a Werner Herzog documentary about four seasons in Siberia and the lives of the people who live there.
<P>
You don't find it particularly exciting, and you will far longer remember the location and circumstances under which you watch it than anything that happened in the documentary.
<P>
You will watch this on your phone at a bar in your neighborhood while killing time on a Friday night. The bar is a local bar that you and your belated wife could never remember the name of and always just referred to as Ikea for reasons that just seemed to fit. The lighting is a little too white and sterile, and the furniture is, well, a bit Ikea-like. The staff is very nice. They brew their own beer, but almost all of it falls into two categories: extremely hoppy/hazy or extremely sweet-sour/fruity. They usually have at least one darker beer and a cheap pilsner at a bargain price, but their other beers are in glassware you don't enjoy and at price points that seem random and disappointing.
<P>
This isn't the first time you will remember a location and circumstances more than the film. <I>Hot Shots Part Deux</I>, aside from the "Loved you in Wall Street" line, is mostly remembered for sitting on an uncomfortable couch on a bad date you had already given up on but feeling frozen to the spot because the girl you were with insisted you watch it with her while she laid her head in your lap. Your roommate, who had come to rescue you from yet another bad date with this woman, was sitting on the opposite couch openly laughing at you for your dilemma. Nothing came of it, of course. C'est la vie.
