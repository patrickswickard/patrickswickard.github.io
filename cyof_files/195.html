You're going to get your Godard's worth out of this film since it stars Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina. He abandons his wife and kids and bourgeois life to run off with Anna Karina's character, who is naturally being chased by crazed right-wing OAS terrorists. The two of them end up having a lot of bizarre surreal misadventures. They wreck cars and stab dwarves and get caught on a desert island and get waterboarded. Anna Karina's character ends up abandoning Jean-Paul Belmondo for her "brother", who turns out to be her actual boyfriend, and then he kills both of them. Then he paints his face blue and decides to blow himself up with dynamite, though he tries (unsuccessfully) to abandon this plan at the last minute. It's kind of like the film <I>Something Wild</I> mixed with a real-life Wile E. Coyote cartoon.
<P>
It's all pretty impressive as far as mid-life crises go. This is Godard at his loony best.
<P>
You've never painted your face blue (or anything darker than orange, which was part of an Oompa-Loompa costume), but there's a chance that some of your ancestors may have done so. You are French-German on your father's side and English-Scottish on your mother's side. Despite your Irish name, It is not known that there is any Irish in this mix. Of course, because of how exponentiation works, it is highly likely at some point that there were Irish ancestors, but culturally this did not make it into the acknowledged genetic makeup of your family.
<P>
As someone who has Scottish heritage, there is a chance that your Celtic/Pictish ancestors (at least as stereotypically depicted) would paint themselves with woad paint and do amusing things such as burn people alive in wicker cages as human sacrifices and worship trees. You have done none of these things besides worshipping trees, but to be completely honest it's a <I>little</I> bit more nuanced than that.
