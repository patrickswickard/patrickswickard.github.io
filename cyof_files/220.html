TITLE: Les Cousins
TEXT PLACEHOLDER 220
<P>
This is a Claude Chabrol film about two male cousins in a remote town in France. It's not going to be very exciting, and much of it is about the rather pathetic happenings in the little town it is set in. Chabrol is not the most exciting of the French New Wave and associated directors you've seen, but it's good to have a couple of boring ones under your belt. This just isn't going to strike you as very remarkable.
<P>
You're going to watch most of this on a bar on your phone, standing by the non-functional pay phone by the bathroom. Every time you pass this pay phone you check the coin slot for money. Something you've done much of your life, and it's often been fruitful. You have very good reason to believe that you are the only person who ever checks this pay phone's coin slot for money. It is sad to you that other people have stopped believing in the possibility of this happening. You refuse to be the last person to give up on the hope of good things happening in the world.
