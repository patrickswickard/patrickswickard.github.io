This is another Herzog documentary about a German-Peruvian woman who was the sole survivor when her plane flight crashed in the jungle, which killed the other 91 people on the flight. They visit the crash site, finding several pieces of the plane still embedded in the jungle, then retrace the path that she took from the remote crash site to the small village where she was ultimately found and rescued. It's sort of like a civilian version of <I>Little Dieter Needs to Fly</I>, which you might recognize from Section 68.
<P>
You feel lucky that nearly every flight you have been on has ended with all passengers surviving. The sole exception to this was a flight you took from Paris to New York. Two hours into the flight, you noticed a ruckus several seats in front of you, which appeared to be a man having some manner of medical emergency. To your amazement, the cabin crew got on the microphone and asked if there were any medical professionals on board, and requested for them to proceed to the front of the aircraft--just like in the movies. A few grim-faced individuals did so, and soon after you noticed the flight start to turn in midair on the in-flight tracker on the screen on the seat.
<P>
It became obvious that your flight was not going to land on time. Minutes later the cabin crew, again trying to sound calm, asked if any passengers on board had a certain type of medication or piece of medical equipment, though they didn't sound hopeful this would be the case. Eventually they stopped working on the guy, who sat unconscious and awkwardly slumped in his seat. A few hours later the plane landed briefly in Ireland and the local airport paramedics took the stiff man off the plane as the pilot apologized for the "medical emergency". No information was given about the man's condition, but from where you sat it didn't look promising for him. The rest of you landed in New York as promised, delayed but still alive and relatively healthy.
