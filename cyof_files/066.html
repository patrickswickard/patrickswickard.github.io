This is the Herzog film that features a protagonist by the name of Stroszek but isn't the Herzog film from Section 59 with the title <I>Stroszek</I> featuring a protagonist with the same name played by that weird little guy, Bruno S. Once again, as you will learn or have learned in other sections, it is important to keep your Herzog films stored in tightly sealed individual containers so that they don't leak into each other--and yes, this goes for the documentaries as well.
<P>
In this film Stroszek is one of three German soldiers tasked with guarding a dump site of unusable munitions in a small fort on a Greek island. Unlike the eponymous Woyzeck from the other Herzog film in section 32 (not to be confused with <I>Stroszek</I>), these guys are allowed to eat things besides peas. They seem nourished enough but are clearly going stir-crazy because of their pointless, monotonous job. They are bored enough to do Herzog-related nonsense like hypnotizing chickens. Eventually one of these guys flips his shit, starts shooting at random people, and puts on quite a fireworks display at the munitions depot.
<P>
There's also a shot of a bunch of windmills that was clearly recycled from <I>The Wild Blue Yonder</I> in section 65. Or vice-versa, depending on whether you're reading this section first. Blame it on the time-traveling astronauts from <I>Interstellar</I> or <I>Arrival</I> or whatever that film is that you already watched or will soon watch.
