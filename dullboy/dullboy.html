<h2><b>Dull Boy Publications</b></h2>
<p>
Dull Boy Publications is a micropublisher based in Baltimore, MD. We specialize in cheaply publishing zines, photography books, art books, fiction and poetry, and other experiments. Right now we are a "friends and family" endeavor, but watch this space and pardon the mess...
<p>
Here are some projects that Dull Boy Publications will freely admit to printing.
